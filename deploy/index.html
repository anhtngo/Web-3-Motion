                        <h2>Vincent Willem van Gogh</h2>
                        <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who
                            posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western
                            art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty.</p>

                        <h2><span>Born and raise</h2>
                        <p>Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and
                            thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed
                            after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant
                            missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting
                            in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him
                            financially, and the two kept a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still
                            lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that
                            distinguished his later work.</p>

                        <h2><span>Van Gogh medical condition</h2>
                        <p>Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental
                            stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His
                            friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed
                            part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at
                            Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near
                            Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression continued,
                            and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a Lefaucheux revolver. He died from
                            his injuries two days later.</p>
